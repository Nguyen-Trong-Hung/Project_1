## Week 1

### Problem 1: Sum Array

Given a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an. Compute the sum Q of elements of this sequence.
 
### Problem 2: List sequence of integer having 3 digits divisible by n


Given a positive integer n, find all integer having 3 digits which is divisible by n.

### Problem 3: Compare the difference in electricity prices according to EVN's new proposal

Currently, electricity prices are calculated according to a ladder of 6 levels (adjusted from May 4, 2023), with the lowest price (level 1) being 1,728 VND and the highest price being 3,015 VND. However, EVN is proposing a new step-by-step method of calculating electricity prices including only 5 levels as shown below, the lowest price (level 1) is about 1,728 VND per kWh and the highest (level 5) is 3,457 VND per kWh.

### Problem 4: Convert a TEXT to Upper-Case


Given a TEXT, write a program that converts the TEXT to upper-case. 

### Problem 5: Extract Year, Month, Date from a String YYYY-MM-DD

Given a date which is a string under the format YYYY-MM-DD (in which YYYY is the year, MM is the month (the month is from 1 to 12), and DD is the date (the date is from 1 to 31)). Extract the year, month and date.


### Problem 6: List all numbers from 1 to n and its squares

Each line i (i = 1,...,n): contains i and i^2 (elements are separated by one SPACE character)

### Problem 7: Count odd and even number from a sequence

Given a sequence of integer a1, a2, ..., an. Count the number of odd elements and even elements of the sequence.

### Problem 8: Add Subtract Multiplication Division of A and B

Given 2 integers a and b. Compute a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b.

### Problem 9: Solve degree-2 polynomial equation

Given an equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Find solution to the given equation.

## Week 2

### Problem 1: Compute C_k_n

Given two positive integers k and n. Compute C(k,n) which is the number of ways to select k objects from a given set of n objects.

### Problem 2: Binary sequence generation

Given an integer n, write a program that generates all the binary sequences of length n in a lexicographic order.

### Problem 3: Binary sequences generation without consecutive 11

Given an integer n, write a program that generates all binary sequences without consecutive 11 in a lexicographic order.

### Problem 4: Permutation generation

Given an integer n, write a program to generate all permutations of 1, 2, ..., n in a lexicalgraphic order (elements of a permutation are separated by a SPACE character).

### Problem 5: Count number of sudoku solutions

Write a program to compute the number of sudoku solutions (fill the zero elements of a given partial sudoku table)
Fill numbers from 1, 2, 3, .., 9 to 9 x 9 table so that:
* Numbers of each row are distinct
* Numbers of each column are distinct
* Numbers on each sub-square 3 x 3 are distinct
